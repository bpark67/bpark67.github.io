description: The relationship between forest cover loss and infectious disease risk is poorly understood and needs further investigation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and with regards to the effect to vulnerable populationsâ€”namely, children. The proposed research examines ecological determinants of malarial disease by investigating the linkage between forest cover change and in Kenya using a total population incidence indicator, and a pediatric prevalence indicator.
