  abstract: >
    Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals that are increasingly being
    detected in groundwater. The negative health consequences associated with human exposure to PFAS
    make it essential to quantify the distribution of PFAS in groundwater systems. Mapping PFAS
    distributions is particularly challenging because a national patchwork of testing and reporting
    requirements has resulted in sparse and spatially biased data. In this analysis, an
    Inhomogeneous Poisson Process (IPP) modeling approach is adopted from ecological statistics to
    continuously map PFAS distributions in groundwater across the contiguous United States. The
    model is trained on a unique dataset of 8,910 PFAS groundwater measurements, using combined
    concentrations of two PFAS analytes. The IPP model predictions are compared with results from
    random forest models to highlight the robustness of this statistical modeling approach on sparse
    datasets. This analysis provides a new approach to not only map PFAS contamination in
    groundwater but also prioritize future sampling efforts.
